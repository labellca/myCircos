# This is the main configuration file for the Circos tableviewer. This
# file also depends on colors.conf (definition on basic colors),
# ideogram.conf (size and spacing of row/cell segments), and
# ticks.conf (tick spacing and label definitions - these are turned
# off by default).
#
# In addition to these configuration files, the bin/make-conf script
# creates colors.conf (colors of row/col segments) and
# colors_percentile.conf (colors based on cell percentile
# values). These configuration files are also included via the
# <<include>> directive.
#
# Some elements of the output image are toggled off by default
# (e.g. row and column highlights, anchor links to segment labels,
# tick marks).
